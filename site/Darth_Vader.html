At the beginning a promising young jedi named Anakin Skywalker seemed to be the chosen one, the prophesized jedi that would bring
balance to the force. Found at Tatooine by jedi master Qui gon Jin and his young padawan Obi Wan Kenobu, Jin knew the boy had a potentia to become a powerful jedi.

The young boy would become a great jedi indeed, however his attachments later prooved to be his greatest weakness as Darth Sidious disguised as senator and later emperor Palpatine would take advantage of by luring the boy to the darkside.

Sadly Skywalker's fears would cause his fall and eventually reborn as one of the most famous sith the galaxy would come to know for years to come, Darth Vader.
